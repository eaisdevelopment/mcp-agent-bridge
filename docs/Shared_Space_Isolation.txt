By default all bridge instances share ~/cloud_code_bridge as the state folder. So if you register "backend" in project A, and then "backend" in project B, they'd collide.

  The fix is the CC_BRIDGE_STATE_PATH env var. Set a different path per project in each project's .mcp.json:

  Project A (.mcp.json):
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "cc-bridge": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@essentialai/cc-bridge-mcp-server"],
        "env": {
          "CC_BRIDGE_STATE_PATH": "~/project-a-bridge"
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Project B (.mcp.json):
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "cc-bridge": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@essentialai/cc-bridge-mcp-server"],
        "env": {
          "CC_BRIDGE_STATE_PATH": "~/project-b-bridge"
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Each project gets its own state file, logs, and lock — completely isolated. Both the backend and frontend .mcp.json within the same project just need to point to the same path so they
   share state with each other.

  You can also use the setup wizard (npx @essentialai/cc-bridge-mcp-server init) which handles this for you.
