## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Config + error handling first because config layer is prerequisite for test isolation and cross-platform support
- [Roadmap]: Testing before new features so health check and stale peers can be developed with test coverage from the start
- [Roadmap]: 5 phases at standard depth; research suggested similar structure
